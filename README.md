# Java Data Structures Project

Welcome to my Java Data Structures project! This project is a collection of various data structures implemented in Java, including hash tables, heaps, queues, and stacks.

## Overview

This project aims to provide implementations of fundamental data structures commonly used in computer science and software engineering. Each data structure is designed and implemented to be efficient, scalable, and easy to use.

## Implemented Data Structures

### 1. Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

### 2. Heap

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a min heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is less than or equal to the key of C. The same property applies to a max heap, but in reverse.

### 3. Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are inserted at the rear (enqueue operation) and removed from the front (dequeue operation). It supports operations such as enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty.

### 4. Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are inserted and removed from the same end, known as the top of the stack. It supports operations such as push (to insert), pop (to remove), peek (to view the top element), and isEmpty.

## How to Use

To use the data structures provided in this project, simply import the relevant classes into your Java project. Each data structure class contains methods to perform common operations such as insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements. Refer to the Javadoc or inline comments for detailed usage instructions.
